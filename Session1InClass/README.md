Is your solution fully working or not?   How does your driver program demonstrate this?

I think my solution is fully working. I add a $zippy after the original template to test the 
zippy class and template "$zippy" in class template. I also add a "$newline" before "$zippy" to
test the template language "newline" in the template class. As a result, Driver will print out
a sentence include the template that appeared in last week's class and follow by a zippy quote
randomly chosen from yoe.lines file in a new line.

What extra credit problem(s) did you work on?  If so, how do you demonstrate the functionality?

I have done the first extra credit problem. I change the argument that will be passed to greeter
from driver to test if tmy code can change from a random selection to a sequential selection. 
Additionally, I add couple $zippy in the original template when I want to test the sequential 
functionality. I will check if it follow the order of yow.lines. However, if the I use different 
template string(like template1 = "$zippy", template2 = "$zippy") to run the drive it will print same
zippy quote because I iterate the line number in template.
   
How much time did you spend on the assignment?

I use about 4 hours to finish this assignment.

Overall how did you like the homework?

I can review my knowledge received from class last week.
I can also improve my programming skill in Java
